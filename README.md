# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – C Programs

This repository contains C-based implementations of various **Data Structures and Algorithms**, developed as part of academic coursework. Each program demonstrates a specific data structure or algorithmic concept implemented using the C programming language.

Repository Link:  
https://github.com/pokharelayam1/DSA-Assignment.git

## Project Organization

The repository is organized into multiple folders using the format:


Each `Prog_<number>` directory contains:

- The C source file for the respective assignment  
- Corresponding documentation (if included)  

Each folder represents an independent DSA program.

## Overview of the Programs

- Covers fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts  
- Implemented using C programming language  
- Structured and readable code format  
- Designed for academic practice and conceptual clarity  
- Focused on strengthening problem-solving skills  

## Technology Used

- Programming Language: C  
- Compiler: GCC  

## How to Execute the Programs

Follow the steps below to run any program from this repository:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pokharelayam1/DSA-Assignment.git
```
Step 2: Open a Program Directory

```bash
cd dsa_assignment/Prog_<number>
```
Step 3: Compile the Source Code
```bash
